# OLTPBench

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oltpbenchmark/oltpbench.png)](https://travis-ci.org/oltpbenchmark/oltpbench)

Benchmarking is incredibly useful, yet endlessly painful. This benchmark suite is the result of a group of
Phd/post-docs/professors getting together and combining their workloads/frameworks/experiences/efforts. We hope this
will save other people's time, and will provide an extensible platform, that can be grown in an open-source fashion. 

OLTPBenchmark is a multi-threaded load generator. The framework is designed to be able to produce variable rate,
variable mixture load against any JDBC-enabled relational database. The framework also provides data collection
features, e.g., per-transaction-type latency and throughput logs.

Together with the framework we provide the following OLTP/Web benchmarks:
  * [TPC-C](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/)
  * Wikipedia
  * Synthetic Resource Stresser 
  * Twitter
  * Epinions.com
  * [TATP](http://tatpbenchmark.sourceforge.net/)
  * [AuctionMark](http://hstore.cs.brown.edu/projects/auctionmark/)
  * SEATS
  * [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB)
  * [JPAB](http://www.jpab.org) (Hibernate)
  * [CH-benCHmark](http://www-db.in.tum.de/research/projects/CHbenCHmark/?lang=en)
  * [Voter](https://github.com/VoltDB/voltdb/tree/master/examples/voter) (Japanese "American Idol")
  * [SIBench](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~fekete/teaching/serializableSI-Fekete.pdf) (Snapshot Isolation)
  * [SmallBank](http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5353/1/michael-cahill-2009-thesis.pdf)
  * [LinkBench](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~tga/pubs/sigmod-linkbench-2013.pdf)

This framework is design to allow easy extension, we provide stub code that a contributor can use to include a new
benchmark, leveraging all the system features (logging, controlled speed, controlled mixture, etc.)
